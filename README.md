# Advent of code
This directory includes my advent of code answers over the last few years. Not all years are finished. Most of the entries are done in Rust, although there are a few in Kotlin.
Not all entries follow any sort of good naming conventions nor are most of the entries optimal.

## Advent_init
The purpose of advent_init is to initialize a skeletal structure for the current day. 
### Usage
```
./advent_init {event_day} {event_year}
```
