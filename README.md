# Advent of code
This directory include my advent of code answers over the last few years. Not all years are finished. Most of the entries are done in Rust, although there are a few in Kotlin.

## Advent_init
The purpose of advent_init is to initialize a skeletal structure for the current day. 
### Usage
```
./advent_init {event_day} {event_year}
```
